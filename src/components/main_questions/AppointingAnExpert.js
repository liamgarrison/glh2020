              In most cases you will need to appoint an expert to provide evidence of the disrepair, especially where it is serious.  
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
            Where it is not, an expert may not be needed, and it may be enough to rely on receipts, pictures and videos. 
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
            At this stage it is common to suggest appointing a joint expert which means that the expert will give evidence on yours and the landlordâ€™s behalf. The benefit is that the cost will be split equally.  
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
        The landlord could decide to appoint their own expert, in which case you will be solely responsible for the costs of your expert.
